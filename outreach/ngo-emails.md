**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: $PROTECT Token - Automated Donations for Child Protection Technology

Dear Thorn Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to introduce an innovative cryptocurrency project that aligns perfectly with Thorn's mission to leverage technology for child protection.

**About $PROTECT**

$PROTECT is a Solana-based cryptocurrency (Token-2022 standard) launching in April 2026 during Child Abuse Prevention Month. What makes this project unique is our built-in donation mechanism: every transaction automatically includes a 1.5% transfer fee, with 0.5% going directly to verified child protection organizations like Thorn.

This isn't a traditional donation request—we're creating a system that generates automatic, ongoing funding for your vital work. As $PROTECT gains adoption, Thorn would receive consistent, protocol-level donations without any administrative overhead on your end.

**Why This Matters**

Since Thorn's founding in 2012, you've processed over 509 billion files to detect sexual abuse material and helped 700+ law enforcement agencies protect children. Your technology-first approach to child protection makes you an ideal partner for a blockchain-based funding mechanism.

The automatic nature of our donation system means:
- Zero administrative burden for Thorn
- Transparent, on-chain verification of all donations
- Sustainable funding that grows with token adoption
- No solicitation or fundraising efforts required

**Partnership Opportunity**

We would be honored to have Thorn as one of our verified recipient organizations. This would involve:
- Setting up your organization's wallet to receive automated donations
- Optional: Public endorsement of the project's mission
- Full transparency: All transactions are verifiable on-chain

**Resources**
- Project Website: [website-link-here]
- Technical Whitepaper: [whitepaper-link-here]  
- Code Repository: [github-link-here]

We understand that any partnership requires thorough vetting. We're committed to full transparency and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this initiative further, answer any technical questions, and provide additional documentation.

Your innovative work in building technology to protect children has inspired projects like ours. We believe blockchain technology can create sustainable funding streams for the critical work organizations like Thorn do every day.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about this opportunity?

Thank you for your time and for everything Thorn does to protect children in the digital age.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. We're not asking for money—we're giving it to you, automatically, with every transaction. This represents a new paradigm for sustainable non-profit funding.

**Subject:** $PROTECT Token Partnership: Automated Donations Supporting Missing & Exploited Children

Dear NCMEC Leadership Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to introduce a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project that could provide sustainable funding for NCMEC's critical mission of protecting children.

**About $PROTECT**

$PROTECT is a Solana-based cryptocurrency launching in April 2026—perfectly timed with Child Abuse Prevention Month. Our token incorporates an automatic donation mechanism: every transaction includes a 1.5% transfer fee, with 0.5% distributed directly to verified child protection organizations.

This isn't a donation request. Instead, we're offering NCMEC the opportunity to receive automatic, ongoing funding through blockchain technology, with zero administrative burden on your organization.

**Supporting NCMEC's Mission**

For decades, NCMEC has been America's leading resource for child protection, operating the CyberTipline and your 24/7 hotline. Your comprehensive approach—from missing children cases to combating child sexual exploitation—makes you an essential partner for sustainable funding initiatives.

Through $PROTECT's automatic donation system:
- NCMEC receives consistent funding without fundraising efforts
- All donations are transparent and verifiable on-chain
- Zero processing fees or administrative overhead
- Funding grows as token adoption increases

**How It Works**

The donation mechanism is built into the smart contract itself. When someone trades $PROTECT tokens, 0.5% automatically goes to verified organizations like NCMEC. This creates a sustainable funding stream that operates independently of market volatility or donor fatigue.

**Partnership Benefits**
- Sustainable funding stream for NCMEC programs
- Full transparency through blockchain verification  
- No solicitation or administrative burden
- Opportunity to engage with cryptocurrency community around child safety

**Next Steps**

We would be honored to include NCMEC as one of our verified recipient organizations. This would involve setting up a wallet to receive donations and optional public support for the project's mission.

**Resources**
- Project Website: [website-link-here]
- Technical Documentation: [whitepaper-link-here]
- Open Source Code: [github-link-here]

We understand that NCMEC maintains rigorous standards for partnerships and funding sources. We're committed to full transparency and would welcome the opportunity to provide additional documentation, answer questions, and discuss this initiative in detail.

Your work protecting children has touched millions of families. We believe innovative funding mechanisms like $PROTECT can help ensure organizations like NCMEC have the resources needed to continue this vital work.

Would NCMEC be interested in learning more about this partnership opportunity?

Thank you for your consideration and for your unwavering commitment to protecting children.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]

**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: $PROTECT Token - Blockchain-Based Funding for Anti-Trafficking Work

Dear Polaris Project Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share an innovative funding opportunity that aligns with Polaris Project's mission to combat human trafficking and support survivors.

**About $PROTECT**

$PROTECT is a Solana blockchain cryptocurrency launching in April 2026 during Child Abuse Prevention Month. Our project features an automatic donation mechanism: every token transaction includes a 1.5% fee, with 0.5% automatically distributed to verified organizations fighting human trafficking and child exploitation.

This represents a new model for sustainable non-profit funding—we're not asking for donations, but rather offering Polaris Project the opportunity to receive ongoing, automatic funding through our protocol.

**Why Polaris Project**

Since 2002, Polaris Project has been a leader in combating human trafficking, operating the National Human Trafficking Hotline and building crucial data insights about trafficking patterns. Your work directly addresses one of our project's core concerns: protecting vulnerable individuals, particularly children, from exploitation.

The intersection of technology and trafficking prevention makes Polaris an ideal partner for a blockchain-based funding initiative. As you've noted, many trafficking victims are exploited through digital platforms—our project aims to leverage technology for protection rather than harm.

**The Funding Mechanism**

Our smart contract automatically distributes donations with each transaction:
- Completely transparent and verifiable on-chain
- No administrative burden for Polaris Project  
- Consistent funding that grows with token adoption
- Zero processing fees or overhead costs

This creates sustainable funding that doesn't rely on traditional fundraising cycles or donor fatigue. As $PROTECT gains adoption, Polaris Project would receive regular, automated contributions to support your critical work.

**Partnership Opportunity**

We would be honored to include Polaris Project as a verified recipient organization. This partnership would involve:
- Setting up a wallet to receive automated donations
- Optional public endorsement of the project's anti-trafficking mission
- Potential collaboration on education about cryptocurrency's role in both enabling and preventing exploitation

**Transparency & Accountability**

Understanding that financial transparency is crucial for organizations like Polaris Project:
- All transactions are publicly verifiable on the Solana blockchain
- Open source code available for technical review
- Clear documentation of fund distribution mechanisms
- Compliance with relevant cryptocurrency regulations

**Resources**
- Project Website: [website-link-here]
- Technical Whitepaper: [whitepaper-link-here]
- Code Repository: [github-link-here]

We recognize that Polaris Project operates with the highest standards of accountability and carefully vets funding sources. We welcome thorough due diligence and are prepared to provide any additional documentation or answer questions about our technical implementation.

Your National Survivor Study and data-driven approach to combating trafficking demonstrate the importance of sustainable, reliable funding for long-term research and program development. We believe blockchain technology can provide exactly that kind of sustainable support.

Would you be interested in discussing this partnership opportunity further? We're happy to arrange a call or provide additional technical documentation.

Thank you for your time and for your crucial work combating human trafficking and supporting survivors.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
$PROTECT Project

**P.S.** Your work has shown how technology can be both a vector for exploitation and a powerful tool for prevention. We see $PROTECT as part of the solution—using innovative technology to sustainably fund the organizations fighting trafficking.
