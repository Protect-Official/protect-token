## 3. Meme Ideas / Concepts (5)

### Meme 1: "The Shield Wall"
**Format:** Drake meme / Two-panel
- Panel 1 (rejecting): "Buying meme coins that only make degens rich"
- Panel 2 (approving): "Buying meme coins that fund child protection"
- $PROTECT logo on the approved panel

### Meme 2: "Files Are Open"
**Format:** Expanding brain meme (4 panels)
1. Brain small: "Ignoring the Epstein files"
2. Brain medium: "Reading the Epstein files"
3. Brain large: "Tweeting about the Epstein files"
4. Brain galaxy: "Buying $PROTECT and actually funding child protection orgs"
