# 🔦 $PROTECT — Whitepaper

**Protecting the Innocent. On-Chain.**

---

## Abstract

$PROTECT is a Solana-based community token with a built-in donation mechanism dedicated to fighting child exploitation worldwide. Every transaction contributes directly to verified NGOs through transparent, on-chain donations.

**"The files are open. Now we act."**

---

## 1. Problem

Child exploitation and trafficking remain among the most underreported and underfunded crises globally. Despite high-profile revelations, systemic action remains slow. Meanwhile, the crypto space generates billions in daily volume — yet rarely channels that energy toward meaningful causes.

## 2. Solution

$PROTECT bridges the gap between crypto culture and real-world impact:

- **Meme energy** drives attention and community
- **Built-in donation tax** ensures consistent funding to NGOs
- **On-chain transparency** proves every dollar donated
- **Community governance** lets holders choose where funds go
