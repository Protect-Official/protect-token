## 3. Logo Concepts

### Concept A: "The Shield" (Primary recommendation)
A minimalist shield shape with a subtle keyhole or eye cut-out in the center. The shield represents protection; the keyhole/eye represents transparency and "opening the files." Clean geometric lines, works at any size.
- **Small icon:** Shield silhouette only
- **Full logo:** Shield + "$PROTECT" wordmark to the right
- **Animation idea:** Shield assembles from particles on page load

### Concept B: "The Beacon"
An upward-pointing beam of light breaking through darkness, forming a subtle "P" shape. Represents hope cutting through corruption.
- Works well as app icon and favicon
- The light beam can animate (pulsing glow)

### Concept C: "Linked Hands"
Abstract, geometric interpretation of hands forming a protective circle around a small figure. Community protection concept.
- More emotional, less "crypto"
- Better for NGO partnership materials
- May not read well at very small sizes

### Logo Rules
- Minimum clear space: 1x logo height on all sides
- Never distort, rotate, or recolor outside palette
- Dark background: use white/gold version
- Light background: use navy/gold version

## 5. Voice & Messaging Guidelines

### DO:
- Use direct, active language ("We donate" not "Donations may be made")
- Lead with impact ("$50,000 donated this quarter")
- Be transparent about challenges
- Use meme culture naturally, not forced
- Reference real data and on-chain proof

### DON'T:
- Exploit children's suffering for marketing
- Use graphic or disturbing imagery
- Make price predictions or financial promises
- Use conspiracy theory language (keep it factual)
- Be preachy or guilt-trip the audience

### Tone Examples:
- ❌ "Children are being trafficked RIGHT NOW and you're doing NOTHING"
- ✅ "Every trade funds the organizations fighting child exploitation. Your portfolio does more than grow."
- ❌ "$PROTECT WILL 100X GUARANTEED 🚀🚀🚀"
- ✅ "We're here for the mission. The market will do what it does. The donations are certain."
