# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 24, 2026**

By accessing the $PROTECT website, purchasing, holding, or transferring $PROTECT tokens, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use our services.

## 1. What is $PROTECT?

$PROTECT is a Solana-based memecoin built on the Token-2022 standard with a 1.5% TransferFee. A portion of fees collected (0.5%) is donated to child protection organizations. $PROTECT is not a security, investment contract, or financial instrument.

## 2. Not Financial Advice

Nothing on our website, social media, whitepaper, or any communication from the $PROTECT team constitutes financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. $PROTECT is a memecoin with no inherent value or guarantee of returns. You should consult your own financial advisor before making any decisions.

**$PROTECT HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE. YOU MAY LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.**

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use our services. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of $PROTECT complies with all laws applicable in your jurisdiction.

## 4. Risks

By using $PROTECT, you acknowledge the following risks:

- **Volatility**: Cryptocurrency prices can drop to zero without warning.
- **Regulatory**: Governments may ban, restrict, or regulate cryptocurrencies at any time.
- **Technical**: Smart contracts and blockchain protocols may contain bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **Liquidity**: You may not be able to sell your tokens when you want to.
- **Loss of Access**: If you lose your private keys, your tokens are gone permanently.
- **No Guarantee of Donations**: While the 1.5% TransferFee is protocol-enforced, the donation process to NGOs involves manual steps. We commit to transparency but cannot guarantee specific donation amounts or timing.

## 5. Transfer Fee

$PROTECT uses Solana Token-2022's TransferFee extension. Every transfer incurs a 1.5% fee, split as follows:

- 0.5% — Donated to child protection NGOs
- 0.5% — Team operations
- 0.5% — Liquidity pool reinvestment

This fee is enforced at the protocol level and cannot be bypassed. The maximum fee per transaction is capped at 100 tokens.

## 6. Charitable Donations

$PROTECT donates a portion of transfer fees to organizations including Thorn, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), and Polaris Project. These organizations have not endorsed, sponsored, or partnered with $PROTECT unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Donations are made quarterly and are documented publicly via on-chain transactions and receipts posted on our website and social media.

## 7. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to:

- Use $PROTECT for money laundering, terrorist financing, or any illegal activity
- Manipulate the market for $PROTECT (wash trading, spoofing, etc.)
- Exploit bugs or vulnerabilities in the token or related smart contracts
- Misrepresent your affiliation with the $PROTECT team
- Use bots or automated systems to abuse the airdrop or any promotional campaigns

## 8. Intellectual Property

The $PROTECT name, logo, website content, and related materials are the property of the $PROTECT team. You may not use them without permission, except for personal, non-commercial use such as sharing on social media.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE $PROTECT TEAM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR TOKENS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF $PROTECT.

THE $PROTECT TEAM'S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID DIRECTLY TO THE TEAM (EXCLUDING OPEN MARKET PURCHASES), IF ANY.

## 10. No Warranty

$PROTECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE TOKEN, WEBSITE, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the $PROTECT team from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of $PROTECT or violation of these Terms.

## 12. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on our website and GitHub. Your continued use of $PROTECT after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 13. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in the user's jurisdiction. Any disputes shall be resolved through good-faith negotiation before pursuing other remedies.
