# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 24, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how $PROTECT collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our website and services.

## 1. What We Collect

We collect minimal data, only what is necessary for our services:

### Airdrop Waitlist
When you sign up for the airdrop waitlist, we collect:
- **Solana wallet address** — to distribute tokens
- **Twitter/X handle** — to verify participation requirements

### Automatically Collected
- **On-chain transaction data** — this is public by nature of blockchain technology and not collected by us specifically

### What We Do NOT Collect
- No cookies or tracking pixels
- No IP address logging
- No browsing behavior analytics
- No email addresses (unless voluntarily provided)
- No personal identification documents

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used exclusively for:
- Processing and distributing airdrop tokens to eligible participants
- Verifying airdrop eligibility (Twitter follow/retweet requirements)
- Communicating airdrop-related updates (via Twitter/Telegram, not direct messages)
- Aggregate, anonymized statistics (e.g., total waitlist count displayed on website)

We will never:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Share individual wallet addresses or Twitter handles publicly

## 3. Data Storage

Airdrop waitlist data is stored using **Supabase**, a cloud database platform:
- Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Supabase infrastructure is hosted on AWS
- Access to the database is restricted to the $PROTECT team
- Row-level security (RLS) is enabled to prevent unauthorized access

## 4. Data Retention

- **Airdrop waitlist data** is retained until the airdrop distribution is complete, then deleted within 90 days
- **On-chain data** (transactions, token transfers) is permanent and public by nature of blockchain technology — this is outside our control

## 5. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **Supabase** — database hosting ([supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy))
- **GitHub Pages** — website hosting ([github.com/privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement))
- **Google Fonts** — web fonts loaded from Google's CDN

We do not use any advertising, analytics, or tracking services.

## 6. Blockchain Data

$PROTECT operates on the Solana blockchain. All token transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. This includes:
- Wallet addresses involved in transactions
- Transaction amounts and timestamps
- Transfer fee collections

This is inherent to blockchain technology and cannot be altered or deleted.

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access** — request what data we hold about you
- **Correction** — request correction of inaccurate data
- **Deletion** — request deletion of your airdrop waitlist entry
- **Portability** — request your data in a machine-readable format
- **Withdraw** — withdraw from the airdrop waitlist at any time

To exercise any of these rights, contact us via Twitter DM (@Protect_Proj) or Telegram (@ProtectToken).

## 8. International Users

Our services are available globally. By using $PROTECT, you consent to the transfer of your data to servers that may be located outside your country of residence. We take reasonable measures to ensure your data is protected regardless of location.

### For EU/EEA Users (GDPR)
- Legal basis for processing: consent (airdrop signup) and legitimate interest (service operation)
- You may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority
- Data transfers outside the EU are covered by Supabase's standard contractual clauses

### For California Users (CCPA)
- We do not sell personal information
- You have the right to know what data is collected and request its deletion
- We do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights

## 9. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect data from individuals under 18. If you believe a minor has submitted data through our services, contact us and we will delete it promptly.

## 10. Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data:
- HTTPS encryption for all website traffic
- Database access restricted via API keys and RLS policies
- No plaintext storage of sensitive information

However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on our website and GitHub with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance.
